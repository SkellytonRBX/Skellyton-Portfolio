            Hey! I'm Skellyton (also known as JAcoboiskaka1121)!<br><br>

I’m a passionate Roblox developer specializing in scripting, UI design, and music composition. I’ve been on Roblox for over 6 years and have been developing games for about 2 and a half years.<br><br>

My primary expertise is in <b>Luau</b> (the scripting language used on Roblox), but I also have some experience with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, which I used to create this website.<br><br>

I got into game development around late 2021/early 2022, initially motivated by the success of front-page games and the idea of making Robux through development. However, my perspective changed as I realized that creating high-quality, player-focused games is far more rewarding than following trends like gambling simulators. Since then, I’ve been focused on honing my skills to create engaging and fun experiences for players.<br><br>

<b>Why I Love Development</b><br><br>
I’m driven by the desire to craft immersive and enjoyable experiences. My goal isn’t just to make games for profit, but to create something that players truly enjoy. Whether it’s scripting complex mechanics or designing beautiful user interfaces, I’m always looking to push my limits and improve as a developer.<br><br>

<b>Skills & Expertise</b><br><br>

<b>Scripting</b>: I specialize in <b>Luau</b> scripting, working on systems like movement mechanics, camera bobbing for added immersion, and menu systems that are intuitive and user-friendly.<br><br>

<b>UI Design</b>: I design functional and visually appealing user interfaces that are easy to navigate, ensuring players have an enjoyable experience.<br><br>

<b>Music Composition</b>: I compose original music to add atmosphere and immersion to my games, enhancing the overall experience.<br><br>

<b>Creative Process</b><br>
My approach to development focuses on creating engaging experiences that are both fun and accessible. I prioritize player experience and strive to make each game feature feel purposeful and rewarding. I enjoy taking a hands-on approach from concept to completion, refining both gameplay and design.<br><br>

I’m always eager to improve and learn new skills, and I look forward to creating even more exciting projects in the future. Thanks for visiting my page!
